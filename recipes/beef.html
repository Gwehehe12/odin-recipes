        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li> 
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>8 ounces mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the beef strips with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet or Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high
        heat. Add the beef strips and cook until browned on all sides. Remove the beef
        from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about
        5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and sliced mushrooms, and cook until the
        mushrooms are tender.</li>
        <li>Return the beef to the skillet. Pour in the beef broth, Worcestershire sauce,
        and Dijon mustard. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer
        for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the beef is tender.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix the sour cream and flour until smooth. Stir this mixture
        into the skillet and cook for an additional 5-10 minutes, until the sauce has thickened.</li>
        <li>Serve the beef stroganoff over cooked egg noodles or rice. Enjoy!</li>
